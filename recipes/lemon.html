    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Can you blend a whole lemon into a cake? Sure you can! Our new Whole Lemon Blender Cake uses every bit of the
        lemon to make a light, bright, and irresistibly lemony dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>baking spray</li>
        <li>1 large thin skinned lemon</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon extract</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice, plus zest for garnish (from 1 lemon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat a 9-x-5-inch loaf pan
            with baking spray and line with parchment, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all 4 sides. Spray parchment lightly
            with baking spray.</li>
        <li>Trim and discard lemon ends, slice lemon into 8 wedges and remove seeds. Place seeded lemon wedges, sugar,
            canola oil, sour cream, eggs, and lemon extract in a blender. Add flour, baking powder, and salt. Process
            until just combined and a smooth, thick batter is formed, about 25 seconds, stopping to scrape down sides
            and gently stirring every 5 seconds. Pour batter in the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted into center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes,
            tenting with foil after 30 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 10 minutes, using parchment overhang as handles,
            carefully remove cake from pan. Transfer to a wire rack; let cool at room temperature, 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk together powdered sugar and lemon juice in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Spread powdered sugar mixture over cooled cake and garnish with lemon zest.</li>
    </ol>
