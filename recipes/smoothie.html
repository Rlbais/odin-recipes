    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This frozen fruit smoothie is fast, simple, nutritious, and tasty with extra protein from the Greek yogurt. It’s
        a great on-the-go breakfast or afternoon snack. I always include a banana, but choose your favorite frozen
        fruits such as strawberries, cherries, pineapple, raspberries, and blueberries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>9 ounces pineapple juice</li>
        <li>2 cups assorted frozen fruit (your choice)</li>
        <li>1 frozen banana, cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 cup vanilla Greek yogurt (such as Cabot® 2%)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add juice, frozen fruit, frozen banana, and yogurt to the jar of a blender, and process until smooth. If too
            thick, add a little more pineapple juice until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Pour into glasses and serve.</li>
    </ol>
